Preregistration,Deviation,Reason
Investigate sample in Kantak & Winstein (2012) for publication bias.,We did not re-analyze the Kantak & Winstein sample.  ,"The Kantak & Winsten (2012) study sampled a variety of practice and feedback interventions that we suspected would be heterogenous in effect. Upon reflection, we felt that applying publication bias tests with this sample would be inappropriate."
Outcome measure priority list did not include measure total error (E).,We added E to our priority list in the fourth position.,"We failed to anticipate E as a measure when constructing our priority list. Because E provides an overall error score, we placed it above component error scores like absolute and relative timing error."
Standardized mean change from immediate to delayed retention sensitivity analysis.,We did not include any analyses of standardized mean change. ,"We did not have access to the raw data from any study that included both an immediate and delayed retention test and were therefore unable to calculate a range of plausible correlation statistics for this specific comparison. Based on our multilevel analysis and additional sensitivity analyses, we felt this additional sensitivity analysis was unnecessary. "
Prespecified analysis script,The final analysis script included substantially more data wrangling and sensitivity analyses than originally included. Some of the variables took on different names than originally specified.,Analyzing the data as thoroughly as possible required more code than initially developed. All the preregistered analyses remained in the final code.
